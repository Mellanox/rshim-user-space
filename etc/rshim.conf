# Once set to 1, the driver will ignore all rshim writes and returns 0 for
# rshim read. It could be used in certain cases, such as during FW_RESET or
# bypassing the rshim PF to VM
#
#DROP_MODE     0

#
# Once set to 1, the driver will be put rshim driver in ownership-forceable mode
# (aka, Force Mode):
#
# 1. It also always enables "/dev/rshim<N>/" creation even when rshim is not
#    attached, allowing user to manually send a ownership request to
#    "/dev/rshim<N>/misc" interface at any time.
#
# 2. It will send a one time ownership request command to the other rshim
#    backend upon start-up if the rshim interface is already attached by another
#    backend. This one-time request is for each rshim device present (one
#    request for rshim0, one for rshim1, etc) and will not be repeated until the
#    next driver restart.
#
# For example, if the current rshim driver is running from host via PCIe, but
# the rshim device is already in use by the other rshim driver running from BMC
# via USB, then with this option it will try to force the other rshim driver to
# release the rshim device. The success of this operation depends on the other
# rshim driver's implementation and behavior.
